(pulled form fortybelowthegame.com)

OBJECT OF THE GAME

To be the player with the lowest score after 10 completed 
rounds of play.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLAYING THE GAME

The game can be played with 2 to 6 players. Each player 
draws a card from the deck. The player that draws the highest 
card deals first and the player that draws the lowest card is 
the “Score Keeper” for that game. 

Once the cards are well shuffled, each player is dealt 6 cards 
face down. 

Without looking at the cards each player arranges their cards 
in two rows of 3 cards face down (as shown below) and 
reveals two cards of their choice.

The person to the left of the dealer starts play by turning one 
card from the top of the deck, this then becomes the 
“DISCARD PILE”. Players have one of three choices for each 
of their turns, they may:
-Reveal one of their 6 cards that has not yet been 
revealed OR;
-Take the top card from the deck and either replace 
one of their 6 cards or discard that card OR;
-Take the top card from the discard pile and replace 
one of their 6 cards then discard the replaced card.

Play continues in this manner until one player turns their last 
card. Once a player turns the last card it signifies the 
end of that round of play(be careful not to turn or look 
at your last card until you are ready to “GO OUT”). All 
other players are allowed one last turn to improve their hand.
Players must then turn all unrevealed cards. The score is then 
tallied and recorded for that round. The deal progresses to the 
left after each round and play continues for a total of 10
rounds. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLACEMENT OF CARDS 

CANCEL - If a player matches any two cards directly above and 
below each other (as shown below) the cards cancel each 
other and therefore result in a score of “0” for those two cards
(even -1s & -10s).

FORTY BELOW – If a player matches any four cards in a block 
(as shown below) they will be given a score of “-40” for those 
four cards.

NOTE: The lowest possible score for a single round is -51
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PENALTIES

In the event that a player turns the last card and “GOES OUT”, 
if they do not have the lowest score they will be assessed a 
penalty of 10 points for each player with a score equal to or 
less than theirs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SCORING

At the conclusion of each round of play, the “Score Keeper” 
asks each player to tally their score and records them on the 
score pad.

Cards are tallied at face value except for those cards which 
“CANCEL” or are in a block of “FORTY BELOW”. Don’t forget 
any penalties!

After recording the scores for each round and totaling scores 
the “Score Keeper” should announce all scores.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

WINNING THE GAME

The game is over after the completion of 10 rounds of play. 
The player with the lowest total score is the “WINNER”.
